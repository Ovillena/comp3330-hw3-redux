      <p>Hola. Mi llamo Octavio. </p>
      <p>
        Before being a student at BCIT now, I worked as IT support for Lululemon
        (previously full-time, but now I just work on weekends for the time
        being), and am also a reservist for the Canadian Army with the New
        Westminster Regiment.

        In our design course for our first semester, we had to do the
        Myers-Briggs personality test and share it to introduce ourselves. I am
        an Entertainer ESFP-A. No extremes, but mostly middle of the board for
        all traits except for 'A -Assertive'.

        My hobbies are boxing, video games. Recently got into playing
        Billiards/Pool. I'm a fan of The Office, Lord of the Rings, Metal Gear
        Solid, Running man, and Street Fighter just to name a few.{" "}

        I like to stay hydrated by drinking tea. Mate Java Expresso is a flavour
        of tea that I'm liking recently.
